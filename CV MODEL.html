    <p><i>Nuclear Scientist.</i></p>
    <i>From Harvard University USA.  </i><br>
<i>Phd in Radioactivity and Atomic Physics.</i><br><br>

<p>I made significant contributions to physics in the fields of quantum mechanics and nuclear physics, including the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions; work on the theory of positrons, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum field theory; and the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion. With his students, he also made major contributions to astrophysics, including the theory of cosmic ray showers, and the theory of neutron stars and black holes.

In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 was appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success, and on July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the weapons were used on Japan in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to date the only uses of nuclear weapons in conflict.</p><br><hr>
<H4>United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)</H4>
<p>In 1947, I was appointed director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the new United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He lobbied for international control of nuclear power and weapons in order to avert an arms race with the Soviet Union, and later opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb, partly on ethical grounds. During the Second Red Scare, his stances, together with his past associations with the Communist Party USA, led to an AEC security hearing in 1954 and the revocation of his security clearance. He continued to lecture, write, and work in physics, and in 1963 received the Enrico Fermi Award for contributions to theoretical physics. The 1954 decision was vacated in 2022.</p>

<h4>Hobbies</h4>
<p>Main hobbies and interests included mineralogy, poetry, and languages, such as Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and Dutch. He also had a strong love for intellectual challenges, often reading books outside his scientific field, like Karl Marx's "Das Kapital" and Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time". Additionally, he enjoyed horseback riding.
